He was trained as a paladin by Uther the Lightbringer and was inducted into the Order of the Silver Hand. Arthas also had a romantic relationship with the kind sorceress Jaina Proudmoore.

2	Death Knight	Male	Despite his promising beginnings, Arthas became one of the most powerful and evil beings Azeroth would ever know. Although he killed the necromancer Kel Thuzad, Arthas was unable to stop the  spread of the plague and resorted to increasingly desperate methods, such as purging the city of Stratholme. Taking up the cursed runeblade Frostmourne, Arthas was able to defeat the demon Mal Ganis, but he lost his soul in the process. Becoming a death knight of the Scourge, he led the undead in destroying Lordaeron, Quel Thalas, and Dalaran. Arthas later made his way to the Frozen Throne of Icecrown and merged with the Lich King.

3	Dark Ranger	Female	Sylvanas was the ranger-general of Silvermoon, whose leadership acumen and martial prowess were without equal. During the Third War, she bravely defended Quel Thalas from a Scourge invasion led by the death knight Arthas Menethil. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas fell in battle. Rather than honor the ranger general with a quick death, Arthas ripped out her soul and transformed it into a banshee a cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich King empowered by hate.     When the Lich Kings control over his minions weakened, Sylvanas broke away from her tyrannical masters control and reclaimed her body. Vowing to avenge her death, Sylvanas gathered other renegade undead and set out to wage war against the Scourge. Thus it was that the Forsaken came to be, with Sylvanas as their queen. Under Sylvanas command, the Forsaken joined the Horde and later helped bring about the Lich Kings fall in the frozen wastes of Northrend. She seeks a higher purpose for a people who have already died once.	Sylvanas Windrunner	Queen of the Forsaken	Undead
4	Necromancer	Male	Gul dan was the first orcish warlock as well as the de facto founder of the Horde. He betrayed both his people and his mentor Ner zhul to the demon lord Kil jaeden for personal gain and power, and was directly responsible for the orcs fall to demonic enslavement and their subsequent invasion of Azeroth. Tutored by the leaders of the Burning Legion, he is considered one of the most powerful warlocks to have ever existed. He founded the Shadow Council and created the first death knights. Gul dan often referred to himself as Darkness Incarnate and "The Destroyer of Dreams.	Gul dan	Master of the Shadow	Orc
5	Warrior	Male	Garrosh grew up on Draenor in the shadow of his father, the great warrior Grommash Hellscream, leader of the Warsong clan. Grom was the first orc leader to drink the blood of Mannoroth, subjugating the orcs to the Legions will. Before this event, Garrosh was among several orcs who had become ill with the red pox. They had been quarantined far away in Nagrand, allowing them to escape the demonic corruption. The younger Hellscream was ashamed of his father for many years until he met Thrall during the invasion of Outland and learned of Groms heroic redemption. Garrosh has since embraced his potential as a strong leader, most notably in Northrend, where he directed the Horde advance through the Borean Tundra and won the hearts of his people. Uncompromising and fiercely proud, Garrosh intended to restore the orcs glory by any means necessary.  As the renewed Alliance Horde war developed, Garroshs thirst for power corrupted him to the point that he did not care about the means used to bring the orcish supremacy on Azeroth, with himself as the worlds supreme ruler  going as far as to unleash the full power of the dead Old Gods heart by resurrecting it using the Pools of Power, effectively destroying half of the sacred pandaren Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

6	Demon Hunter	Male	Illidan Stormrage, commonly known as the Betrayer, is the first of the demon hunters, the former self proclaimed Lord of Outland, the former ruler of the Black Temple, and the original leader of the Illidari. He is the twin brother of Malfurion Stormrage and was, like his sibling, in love with Tyrande Whisperwind. Originally a powerful night elf sorcerer, Illidan officially betrayed his people by defecting to the demonic Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients, though his reasons for doing so were noble as he secretly aimed to repel the Legions invasion. He eventually returned to the side of his fellow night elves, but his creation of a second Well of Eternity at the end of the war caused his people to name him Betrayer and imprison him in the Barrow Deeps below Mount Hyjal. There he remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the warden Maiev Shadowsong and her Watchers.	Illidan Stormrage	Lord and Master of the Illidari	Demon
7	Warrior	Male	During the First War when Varian was a young boy, his father King Llane was murdered and Stormwind was sacked by the Orcish Horde. His guardian and regent Anduin Lothar gathered the survivors and sailed to Lordaeron, where the Alliance of Lordaeron was formed. The Alliance defeated the Horde in the Second War and Stormwind was reclaimed, though at the cost of Lothars life. Varian was crowned King of Stormwind and stood by King Terenas of Lordaeron as the Alliance began to fracture, but soon faced many internal problems. He was unable to reach a settlement between the Stonemasons who rebuilt Stormwind and the House of Nobles, which led to a riot in which his wife Queen Tiffin was killed. While on a diplomatic mission to Theramore, Varian was abducted by the Defias Brotherhood, formerly the Stonemasons, and went missing.	Varian Wrynn	High King of the Grand Alliance	Human
